Recent advancements in neuroscience and machine learning are transforming our understanding of psychiatric disorders, especially psychosis. Leveraging EEG (electroencephalogram) data, researchers can now detect nuanced patterns indicative of psychosis, opening new avenues for early intervention.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

In our recent analysis, we utilized Python, particularly the powerful library MNE, to preprocess EEG data files from patients diagnosed with psychosis and healthy controls. We began by importing and organizing EEG recordings from 41 participants stored in EDF (European Data Format) files.

## Visualization and Exploration

By harnessing data processing techniques and visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, we vividly explored and interpreted EEG signals, capturing essential differences between psychosis and control groups.

## Preprocessing Techniques

Through systematic preprocessing—filtering noise, handling artifacts, and segmenting relevant signals—we prepared the data effectively for predictive modeling. The MNE library streamlined this intricate process, simplifying the extraction of meaningful signal features crucial for machine learning.

## Predictive Modeling and Results

The outcome of our exploration underscored the remarkable potential of EEG-based machine learning models to differentiate between psychotic episodes and typical neurological activity, illuminating the path toward reliable, data-driven psychiatric diagnostics. Such predictive capabilities not only enhance clinical outcomes but also deepen our scientific understanding of psychosis at a neurological level.
